<h1>I'm Alex McInerny ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

This is pretty much my attempt at starting a portfolio of work I've done either at univesrity, or as a personal project to advance my programming skills.

<h2>About me...</h2>

I'm a 3rd year physics student at the University of Oxford, who does have a massive idea of what I'm interested in, and even less clue what I'd like to do after uni. 

At the moment, I'm quite into quantum computing (after doing a fair bit of research to try get an internship, and then getting tragically rejected...), so maybe you'll see some qiskit or similar here. One of my main aims is to get somewhat into data science too. Who knows what else. 

I'm somewhat competent in Python, MATLAB, Mathematica (although I really only use that for help with problem sheets!), and I use LaTeX for my reports. I'm looking to advance a bit into C++ at some point, too, but have work to do on Python before then!. 

<h2>Erm...</h2>

Well this looks a bit naff. Hopefully I'll have more stuff to add in the future, and fingers crossed some links to projects, et cetera!

<h2>Linkedin!</h2>

Not really appropriate to put any other contacts on here I reckon, but [here's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexmcinerny/) the link to my linkedin!
