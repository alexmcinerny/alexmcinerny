<h1>I'm Alex McInerny ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

This is pretty much my attempt at starting a portfolio of work I've done either at univesrity, or as a personal project to advance my programming skills.

<h2>About me...</h2>

I'm a 3rd year physics student at the University of Oxford, trying to find areas of physics/engineering that I may be interested in after completing my degree. 

At the moment, I'm quite into quantum computing (reading 'Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing', Thomas G. Wong), so maybe you'll see some qiskit or similar here. One of my main aims is to get somewhat into data science too. Who knows what else. 

I'm somewhat competent in Python, MATLAB, Mathematica (although I really only use that for help with problem sheets!), and I use LaTeX for my reports. I'm looking to advance a bit into C++ at some point, too, but have work to do on Python before then!. 

<h2>Projects</h2>

All my computational physics projects can be found [here](https://github.com/alexmcinerny/computational-physics-project-portfolio)

And that's all. Bit naff for the moment. I intend to keep on doing projects though, and updating this as I go! 

<h2>Linkedin!</h2>

Not really appropriate to put any other contacts on here I reckon, but [here's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexmcinerny/) the link to my linkedin!
