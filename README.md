<h1>I'm Alex McInerny ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

This is pretty much my attempt at starting a portfolio of work I've done either at school/univesrity, or outside! Some of the work is in progress, some from when I was a bit younger, and some of it is probably just downright awful, but the _plan_ is that by doccumenting it on github, in the long term I'll improve my programming, writing, and public speaking skills! Fingers crossed. 

<h2>About me...</h2>

I'm a 3rd year Oxford physics student, trying to find areas of physics/engineering that I may be interested in after completing my degree. 

At the moment, I'm quite into quantum computing (reading 'Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing', Thomas G. Wong), so maybe you'll see some qiskit or similar here. That said, I have plenty of time left at univesrity to find things i'm interested, and things tend to change pretty fast these days. I'm open to learning absolutely anything, and really enjoy hands on application, so what I dump here may be totally random... 

I'm somewhat competent in Python, MATLAB, Mathematica (although I really only use that for help with problem sheets!), and I use LaTeX for my reports. I'm looking to advance a bit into C++ at some point, too, but have work to do on Python before then!. 

The plan is to keep this pretty up to date, but uni is a busy busy time, so I shan't make any promisses. 

<h2>Programing projects</h2>

Some of my computing projects can be found [here](https://github.com/alexmcinerny/computational-physics-project-portfolio).

<h2>Lectures</h2>

During school and university, I've presented some physics-y/maths-y lectures. A link to that repo can be found [here](https://github.com/alexmcinerny/lectures).

<h2>Reports</h2>

Over school and primerily univesrity, I've also written a series of reports for labs/projects I've worked on. [Here's](https://github.com/alexmcinerny/reports) a link to those!

<h2>Linkedin!</h2>

Not really appropriate to put any other contacts on here I reckon, but [here's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexmcinerny/) the link to my linkedin!
